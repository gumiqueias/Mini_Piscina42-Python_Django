  <h1>Displaying a Static Web Page in Django</h1>
  <p>
    In Django, the process of displaying a static web page involves several key
    components: templates, views, and the request-response cycle. Let's break
    down the steps from the request to the answer.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Request-Response Cycle</h2>
  <p>
    When a user's browser sends a request for a specific URL, Django's server
    receives the request. The server processes the request and determines which
    view should handle it based on URL routing defined in the project's URLs
    configuration.
  </p>

  <h2>2. The View Function</h2>
  <p>
    Views in Django are Python functions that handle the logic for a specific
    URL. A view function receives the request as an input and returns an HTTP
    response. This response could be a rendered template, JSON data, or any
    other form of content.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Template Rendering</h2>
  <p>
    For static web pages, a common approach is to use Django templates. A
    template is an HTML file with embedded template tags and variables. In the
    view function, you can use the <code>render</code> function to combine data
    from the backend with a template. The template engine processes the template
    tags and variables, creating a final HTML page.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Sending the Response</h2>
  <p>
    Once the template is rendered, the view function returns an HTTP response
    containing the HTML content. This response is sent back to the user's
    browser. The browser then displays the static web page to the user based on
    the received HTML and any associated assets (like stylesheets or images).
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The process of displaying a static web page in Django involves the
    interaction of the request-response cycle, view functions, and templates.
    This architectural pattern allows developers to create dynamic and
    interactive web pages by combining data from the backend with HTML
    templates, which are then sent to users' browsers for rendering.
